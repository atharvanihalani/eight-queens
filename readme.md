was messing about w the 8 queens problem and thought I'd try to algorithmize it
...and then i got a bit carried away

June 22nd:
    

everything before June 22nd:
    algorithmized 8 queens – DFS backtracking solution
    annotated it through & through
    generalized it to a (admittedly unwieldy) n-queens alg
    managed to cobble together an even unwieldier(¿) way to parse unique sols
    optimized it (i use the word lightly) from O(n^n) to O(n!) ._.

phew, that's it. right?
SIKE

    created an alg to solve the 4 queens problem for a 4x4x4 chess cube
    realized i can't even visualize a 4x4x4 cube, and created ANOTHER alg to check if a solution is valid
